# A LITTLE REVIEW ! !
So excited to welcome you all back. In-person even! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Say hello again!
- Review ProBuilder, Cinemachine, and the new Input System
- [Here's a link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kypfCwqImEqxiJamrufPnXfPq-lg1OB0?usp=sharing) to some new Input System First Person code for us to look at together
- *I need a little more info from you too!* :)

## 3D Prototyping Kit (Due next week)
In preparation for the prototyping and review we'll do over the next month, I want you to build yourself a little 3D prototyping kit. It can be really simple and composed of a things that you build/set up from scratch, or using things you *still understand* from when you took 3D Game Design. Make as many of these things prefabs as possible (aside from materials)

You will need to create:
1.  __A first person player character with controller script__
    - Your player must be able to move using the keyboard and mouse or a gamepad
    - You can use the original/classic Input Manager, the new Input System ([here's code we looked at in class](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kypfCwqImEqxiJamrufPnXfPq-lg1OB0?usp=sharing)), or player prefabs from the [Unity Starter Pack: First Person Character Controller](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-first-person-character-controller-196525).
    - Your player character must have one action (a verb!) through which they can interact with the level. *You choose!*

2. __Two characters/enemies/friends/npcs with any basic behavior script__
    - Include an animation (using Mixamo perhaps) if you remember how!
    - Try for distinct behaviors not just variations. *One should involve interaction with the player*

3. __One interactive gameobject with behavior script__
    - Could be a collectible, a narrative device. Anything the player comes across in the world and can interact with in some way.
    - Think about what the cause and effect relationship are between the player and this object.

4. __Four environmental objects obstacle with placeholder graphics__ 
    - These can be created with Probuilder, or imported FBX models (which you make or import from the Unity Asset Store)
    - *Ideally*, a little bit of both! 

5. __At least four basic materials that can be applied to different surfaces__
    - Can be as simple as a solid color or more complex and textured

6. __One goal item prefab with script that can be *triggered* by the player__
    - A destination! So it needs to stand out and read as a goal
    - Have it do something: Trigger UI Text (Can be TextMesh Pro if you're into that!), switch scenes, play a song, etc.

## Open Studio
Please work on your kit development here until *at least* 2pm today.


### What to turn in
*Participating in the Global Game Jam?*
    - __YES__: Just put these things in an empty scene so that I can see that they technically work.
    - __NO__: Make a small level as a test scene where you put the kit together in a personally meaningful way.

Either way, I only want *tested* Mac & PC builds uploaded to your Drive folder. Reach out to members of the class on Discord if you need help testing on a platform you don't develop from.

__Homework__
## Two choices this week...
1. Global Game Jam
2. Continue to work on your 3D Prototyping Kit

If you participate in the GGJ, send me a link to your completed game for homework credit this week. Otherwise, upload a build of the progress on your 3D Prototyping Kit by start of class next week.

## Global Game Jam
It's that time again! Maybe warm up for the semester with a little project this weekend? With [this super secret (not-so-secret) theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6on52GnVE0w)?
- The event kicks off at 5pm on Friday (TOMORROW!) on the MICA Game LAb Discord and ends at 5pm on Sunday
- Head over to the MGL Discord if you're looking to join a team or to just say hello!
- More info and register [here](https://globalgamejam.org/2022/jam-sites/mica-game-lab)

## Google Drive
I'll send you a link to your class Google Drive early next week! Or maybe today!
