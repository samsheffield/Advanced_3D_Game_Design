# COLOR!
Hello again! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Take a look at your Post-Processing explorations
- Discuss Color Grading/Lookup Tables (LUTs)
- Introduce Unity's Particle System

## Demo: Color Grading & LUTs
- Here are notes from today's demo ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zRiMmsXNNYSvqq6qI9AYL6nwMzSLFUWu0s1xbe8sL9Q/edit?usp=sharing))

- Here are neutral LUTs for you to use ([link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s0G2oKppQtrKwaPSAafh24eXlESuZC-e?usp=sharing))

## Demo: Particle System
- Unity's Particle System is very powerful so it can be a little overwhelming at first. Today we'll take a look at some of the critical (and fun) things you should know. (If youâ€™re in a hurry, see the [TLDR version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WyLn0Jx-Pcci3iEHzawxRA64yQg34CdNvbYghcDjoX0/edit?usp=sharing))

## Color/ Particle Prototype
Here's the project description ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lEvDTKJyKjCPQvb-5U0itMIEmL4vjsW5AXfvhxJW_3U/edit?usp=sharing))


## Open Studio
Please work on your prototype with whatever remaining time we have in class anywhere on the 2nd floor. _Don't leave early without getting permission._

# Homework

## Two choices this week...
1. Global Game Jam (*why should you participate in this?*). Register [here](https://globalgamejam.org/2023/jam-sites/mica-game-lab).
2. Continue to work on your Color Exploration

### What to turn in
I only want *tested* Mac & PC builds uploaded to your Drive folder. _Send me the link_. 

No project files unless there is an issue you want to resolve. WebGL builds are nice, but secondary, concerns in this class. 

#### Mac builds
We have Macs on the floor that you can run [this fix](https://youtu.be/gHZnBzAtBhU) on. **You must run this fix on a Mac if you are building from a PC before sharing the zipped .app file**. Reach out on the MICA Game Lab Discord if you need help testing on a platform you don't develop from.

### If you participate in the GGJ...
1. Create builds for your exploration started in class today. Upload and send me the link.
2. Send me the link to your GGJ game (even if you didn't manage to finish it!)

### Prototype show & tell next week
We'll start class next week by having you briefly share your prototypes and GGJ games.
