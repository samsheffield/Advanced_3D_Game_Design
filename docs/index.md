### About
This is the class site for Advanced 3D Game Design, taught in the Game Design program by Sam Sheffield (ssheffield@mica.edu).

### Course Description
In this studio course, students will create small 3D games in groups while furthering their understanding of 3D game design, research, and prototyping. The course emphasizes project management skills so that groups can successfully plan and execute their designs. Studio work is supplemented by readings and discussions further exploring contemporary cultural issues surrounding digital games.

### Course Goals
- Continue building Unity game development skills, with emphasis on 3D games. 
- Create space for self-directed game research and development.
- Continue developing a critical vocabulary for discussing video games.
- Continue developing project management and team working skills.


### Student Learning Outcomes
- Students will gain more experience with Unityâ€™s 3D workflow.
- Students will gain familiarity with Unity tools such as Post-Processing, Terrain Tools, Shadergraph, and the URP.
- Students will research, prototype, and develop a small, self-directed 3D game.
- Students will communicate and present game designs from concept to finished form.
