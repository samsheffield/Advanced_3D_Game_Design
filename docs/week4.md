# PARTICLES... IN 3D!
So excited to welcome you all back. I'm not feeling sick! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Hello!
- Take a look at your Post-Processing homework
- Demo: Particle System

## Demo: Particle System
- Unity's Particle System is very powerful so it can be a little overwhelming at first. Today we'll take a look at some of the critical (and fun) things you should know. (If youâ€™re in a hurry, see the [TLDR version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WyLn0Jx-Pcci3iEHzawxRA64yQg34CdNvbYghcDjoX0/edit?usp=sharing))

## Open Studio
Please work on your prototype with whatever remaining time we have in class. If you would like to work remotely, please email documentation of what you accomplished (no matter how small!) by the end of the day.

# Homework

## Prototype 2: Particle Exploration 
Here's the project write up ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gx-m7JRjZgwfZgbue44TdgPWn0EkCqb0mDhrFgpDy68/edit?usp=sharing))

### What to turn in
I only want *tested* Mac & PC builds uploaded to your Drive folder. Reach out to members of the class on Discord if you need help testing on a platform you don't develop from.

### Prototype show & tell next week
We'll start class next week by having you briefly share your prototype. This will become pretty routine since we have a wonderfully sized class!
