# CORE PROJECT: WORK SESSION & LIGHTING REVIEW
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Review proof of concept prototypes
- Work session

## Core Project

A full project description can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tDOYw7MyPxJZYdS6a-K1kuao_4ohD3uiCvcKuJpBMBE/edit?usp=sharing).

## Work Session: Continue Prototyping (Before Lunch)
Your focus over the next three weeks is to do level layout work and develop a playable prototype of your game.

### Level Planning & Blockouts (Due next week)
__1: A digital document collecting level planning__
- 6 parti thumbnails
- 3 bubble diagrams based on the partis you find most interesting
- Floor plans based on your most promising bubble diagrams and marked up with details on encounters, important things in the scenes, and indication of flow/critical paths

__2: A first pass at blocked out/greyboxed version of your game__

Unity project with blocked out scene(s). Player should be able to move around and use basic mechanics in the spaces. Tested Mac & PC builds with included build notes so we can review in class.

## Unity Lighting Review (After Lunch)
Let's do a small review of Unity's lighting system, with specific focus on working with lightmaps and implementing baked lighting. I'll also introduce light probes and how to turn off Ambient Occlusion, which is on by default in the URP Core template.

Unity's documentation on Lighting is (actually) pretty good:
- [Unity Manual entry on Lighting System](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.1/Documentation/Manual/LightingOverview.html)
- [Unity Manual entry on Light Probes](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.1/Documentation/Manual/LightProbes.html)

# Homework

### Continue project development
Complete level planning and blockouts listed above. We'll review in class next week.
