# Intro to VR 2
Welcome back from break. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Review the setup for VR/XR development
- Demo more VR


## Demo: More VR Basics 2
This is going to be a very hands-on demo. Here's what I'd like to cover:
- Fixes: Remedy character controller + held object movement issue
- Teleportation (basic implementation, teleportation area, teleportation anchor)
- XR Ray Interactor (turn off anchor control, changing ray type/appearance, reticles)
- XR Direct Interactor (setting attach transform, adding audio/haptic feedback)
- Creating a physical button and a door using Unity Events and joints (Based on the excellent tutorials by Fist Full of Shrimp!)

I'll upload some short videos here covering everything we do together in class today.

## Open Studio
Please work on your prototype with whatever remaining time we have in class anywhere on the 2nd floor. _Don't leave early without getting permission._

# Homework

## Prototype 8: VR Exploration 2
Here's the project description ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pTy3JOf1fqmHcoGq8B8Y_o0zH75J7yGyytsqEtVYRbA/edit?usp=sharing)). 

If you're looking for additional functionality/ideas, here are some good Youtube channels I'd recommend: 
- [Jason P Barnett](https://www.youtube.com/@JustinPBarnett)
- [VR with Andrew](https://www.youtube.com/@VRwithAndrew)
- [Fist Full of Shrimp](https://www.youtube.com/@FistFullofShrimp)

## Begin ideation for the final project
[Here's the project writeup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XLSn4Q9sUw1EnbngyQbPoJi-MfTJ259bo3u3Nov7PCc/edit?usp=sharing). You are responsible for working with at least one other person for this project. This weekend I'd like you to start circling some ideas. Next week, we'll share ideas and do some team-forming and brain-storming


## VR Headsets
You and your partner are responsible for one VR headset that you are allowed to borrow this week. Take good care of it. Do not lose it or leave it unattended anywhere. If this seems like too much responsibility, we can also coordinate with Sammy Weil in the 4F office to make the headset available to check out to you during his weekday office hours. Let me know.

### What to turn in
I only want the *tested* apk file uploaded to your Drive folder. _Send me the link_. 

No project files unless there is an issue you want to resolve. WebGL builds are nice, but secondary, concerns in this class. 

### Prototype show & tell next week
We'll start class next week by having you briefly share your prototypes.
