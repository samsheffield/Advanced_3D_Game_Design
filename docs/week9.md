# Sideloading apk files and Final Project: Group Formation + Brainstorming
Welcome back from break. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Check out VR explorations
- Sideloading builds onto the Meta Quest 2
- Final project group formation & brainstorming

## Demo: Sideloading .apk files
APK builds from Unity can easily be shared and loaded onto Meta Quest headsets using applications like [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/). 

**Watch out!** There are two different SideQuest installers. Install the *Advanced* desktop application (Mac/PC) from the Downloads page.

### Once SideQuest is installed...
- Click the install apk button from the top of the window (the icon looks like a box with a downward arrow).
- Locate apk file on your computer. *Thisis produced when you build your game in Unity*

### Where is my game?
- Find your installed game on the headset by navigating to the App Index (the icon looks like a grid of dots) and selecting the icon in the top right corner of its window. 

- Choose to filter the list by Unknown Sources and you will see all of your installed games.
- Tip: You can also delete games from here by clicking on the ... menu by each name and then selecting Uninstall. *Keep our headsets clean!*
- Tip #2: Give your projects meaningful names! Otherwise, it might be difficult to find what you're looking for.

## Share builds, play games
Choose one of the prototype you made over the past two weeks and share its apk file on the MGL Discord playesting channel. We'll spend a little time playing and discussing them this morning.

## Recording from the headset
Intersted in recording your VR game? To record from the headset you can install the OpenVR input plugin for OBS from [here](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/openvr-input-plugin.534/).


## Final Project: Brainstorming
Here's the link to the online [jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1fmz5UST6TOcEIvZLUC20buVko7-4BGfvQ6fbRtpGH3A/edit?usp=sharing) that we'll use to brainstorm today. *You'll need to be using your MICA Google account to edit the document.*

# Homework

## Final Project: Project Ideation
Next week, each team will give a brief presentation on their game idea which includes precedents for mechanics, narrative elements, themes, & art direction. An outline for your slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MRfOIbxSUGDb_OteNxvMYAZ8gG4bfAx-dbrSKNwDLXM/edit?usp=sharing)


## Final Project: Begin Developing Proof of Concept Prototype(s)
Develop *at least* one prototype which demonstrates how your game works. This is as much about demonstrating functionality as it is about potential. Show us why this works, not just how it works!

Also, if you canâ€™t have a basic implementation of core mechanics prototyped by this stage you will be discouraged from adding it later. Figure out what is central to your game.

**Do not design levels or focus on visual assets at this point.** Create undesigned sandbox scene(s) which explore core mechanics (the novel or interesting things a player can do in your game), basic player metrics (scale of player to world and basic movement mechanics), and how your core gameplay works. Keep the assets simple but informative/expressive.

Your team will demonstrate the prototype(s) next week.
