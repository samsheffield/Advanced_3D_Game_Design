# COLOR!
So excited to welcome you all back.Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Take a look at your Particles homework
- Demo: LUTs

## Demo: Color Grading & LUTs
- Here are notes from today's demo [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1APxFtx3wmgLHs11ZmSITJ06SKOGrcBSrWFYTaeZnbKE/edit?usp=sharing))
- Here are neutral LUTs for you to use [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1jnA83qBpgnxhHcsv5X_VhxKIUud7ZbEn)
- I'll make a video too!


## Open Studio
Please work on your prototype with whatever remaining time we have in class. If you would like to work remotely, please email documentation of what you accomplished (no matter how small!) by the end of the day.

# Homework

## Prototype 3: Color Exploration 
Here's the project write up ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1av2pnYSKnFnIaEtH9DpMxtzcVuXMTLthu_nY9wJv7HE/edit?usp=sharing))

### What to turn in
I only want *tested* Mac & PC builds uploaded to your Drive folder. Reach out to members of the class on Discord if you need help testing on a platform you don't develop from.

### Prototype show & tell next week
We'll start class next week by having you briefly share your prototype. This will become pretty routine since we have a wonderfully sized class! 

## Project Ideation
Next week we'll have a brainstorming/group formation session for the Core Project (which we'll focus on for the rest of the semester and will be worth 70% or your grade). You'll get a full write-up next week, but this project should be developed on a small in-class team and can be anything you can finish using Unity's 3D workflow.

Some impiortant things regarding next week:
1. Don't miss class next week unless absolutely necessary. If you are sick but can provide documentation and are able to attend online, let me know ASAP so I can restructure things a bit.
2. Arrive on-time
3. Spend some time this week developing a couple of ideas that you might be interested in pursuing, and development roles you might be interested in playing, on a core project. We have a small class so we'll only be able to support a small number of 2-4 person teams.
