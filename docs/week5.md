# COLOR!
So excited to welcome you all back.Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Take a look at your Particles homework
- Demo: LUTs

## Demo: Color Grading & LUTs
- Here are notes from today's demo [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1APxFtx3wmgLHs11ZmSITJ06SKOGrcBSrWFYTaeZnbKE/edit?usp=sharing))
- Here are neutral LUTs for you to use [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1jnA83qBpgnxhHcsv5X_VhxKIUud7ZbEn)
- I'll make a video too!


## Open Studio
Please work on your prototype with whatever remaining time we have in class. If you would like to work remotely, please email documentation of what you accomplished (no matter how small!) by the end of the day.

# Homework

## Prototype 3: Color Exploration 
Here's the project write up ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1av2pnYSKnFnIaEtH9DpMxtzcVuXMTLthu_nY9wJv7HE/edit?usp=sharing))

### What to turn in
I only want *tested* Mac & PC builds uploaded to your Drive folder. Reach out to members of the class on Discord if you need help testing on a platform you don't develop from.

### Prototype show & tell next week
We'll start class next week by having you briefly share your prototype. This will become pretty routine since we have a wonderfully sized class! 

## Project Ideation
Next week we'll have a brainstorming/group formation session for the Core Project (which we'll focus on for the rest of the semester and will be worth 70% or your grade). You'll get a full write-up next week, but this project should be developed on a small in-class team and can be anything you can finish using Unity's 3D workflow.

Some important things regarding next week:
1. Don't miss class next week unless absolutely necessary. If you are sick but can provide documentation and are able to attend online, let me know ASAP so I can restructure things a bit.
2. Arrive on-time
3. Spend some time this week developing a couple of ideas that you might be interested in pursuing, and development roles you might be interested in playing, on a core project. We have a small class so we'll only be able to support a small number of 2-4 person teams.

## Next week: Bo Ruberg talk on Wednesday (02/23) @ 2:30!!

__Video Games to Play after the End of the World: Queer Visions of the Post-Apocalypse__

In this talk, Prof. Bo Ruberg will discuss the rich intersections between queerness and video games. After offering an introduction to queer game studies and queer indie make making, they will dive into the topic of apocalypses and post-apocalypses in video games. Apocalyptic themes are pervasive across game genres. Now, under the shadow of climate collapse and the current pandemic, a growing number of independent queer and trans game designers are using scenes of the end of the world to explore alternate forms of identity, community, and society. Here, Ruberg explains how apocalypses and post-apocalypses take on queer meaning in video games, and how they show us the possibility for creating a new, queerer world after the one that we know today has ended.

And here's a bio:

Dr. Bo Ruberg (they/them) is an associate professor in the Department of Film and Media Studies and an affiliate faculty member in the Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, as well as the incoming co-editor of the Journal of Cinema and Media Studies. Their research explores gender and sexuality in digital media and digital cultures. They are the author of three monographs: Video Games Have Always Been Queer (NYU Press, 2019), The Queer Games Avant-Garde: How LGBTQ Game Makers Are Reimagining the Medium of Video Games (2020), and Sex Dolls at Sea: Imagined Histories of Sexual Technologies (MIT Press, 2022). They are also the co-editor of Queer Game Studies (University of Minnesota Press, 2017) and Live Streaming Culture (MIT Press, forthcoming).
