# Shader Graph Introduction (Part 1)
Some goals for today's class...
- Check out your homework explorations
- Vian Nguyen online class visit
- Demo: Shader Graph Basics (Fragment Shaders)

## Vian Nguyen class visit
Today! MICA GMD alum and Game Designer at [Filament Games](https://www.filamentgames.com/) will be doing an online class visit at 11 am on the MGL Discord. You can also check out some of Vian's personal games [here](https://jubnuggets.itch.io/).

## Demo: Shader Graph Basics

This is going to be a very hands-on demo. _Does anyone need a video?_ Written notes are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qq5yT-cnaDWIxLLKKZai80sQuUc1zlCgxOHJWUPoDRY/edit?usp=sharing).

### Demo Materials
- [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MDjiWPlU_mBQrEAiOV3bPsE1OU2MH0Ht/view?usp=sharing) is a unitypackage with complete versions of everything we build together today, including the texture and script below.
- [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-u9p_CPFbgy_6QToPw7t604PjBdRrYuk/view?usp=sharing) is a simple texture you can use
- [Here](https://gist.github.com/samsheffield/1fc1eadfe03ad76bd60caa6e657d4d5f) is an example of a script manipulating a Shader Graph property.

## Open Studio
Please work on your prototype with whatever remaining time we have in class anywhere on the 2nd floor. _Don't leave early without getting permission._

# Homework

## Prototype 5: Shader Graph Explorations
Here's the project description ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0fjB9G7bUnM-ZmPueC36McnqjCh7tyDSMULGJRtt9w/edit?usp=sharing))

### What to turn in
I only want *tested* Mac & PC builds uploaded to your Drive folder. _Send me the link_. 

No project files unless there is an issue you want to resolve. WebGL builds are nice, but secondary, concerns in this class. 

#### Mac builds
We have Macs on the floor that you can run [this fix](https://youtu.be/gHZnBzAtBhU) on. **You must run this fix on a Mac if you are building from a PC before sharing the zipped .app file**. Reach out on the MICA Game Lab Discord if you need help testing on a platform you don't develop from.

### Prototype show & tell next week
We'll start class next week by having you briefly share your prototypes.
