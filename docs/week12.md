# CORE PROJECT: REVIEW LEVEL LAYOUTS & GREYBOXING
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Review level planning and greyboxing
- Work session

## Core Project
A full project description can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tDOYw7MyPxJZYdS6a-K1kuao_4ohD3uiCvcKuJpBMBE/edit?usp=sharing).

### Art Check In
Let's take a look at your in-progress art assets. This might include: 
- Concept art & reference materials
- Sketches
- 2D & 3D visual assets
- UI inspiration and planning
- Sounds & music (inspiration or in-progress work)

### Work Session
__Please email me documentation of what you accomplished (no matter how small!) by the end of the day today.__

## Milestone 2 prototype is due next week
This is a revised prototype of your game which is fully playable, complete with title screen, any in-game instructions, and audiovisual assets. This prototype needs to be of the _whole game_. 

It's okay for it to have incomplete art assets and bugs (though these should not be "game breaking").

By the start of class:
- Uploaded Mac & PC builds with included build notes (this includes any necessary info not included in-game and known bugs).
- An online document with at least 3 specific playtesting questions
- Share links to our class Discord


# Homework

### Continue project development
- Continue developing your game.
- Next in-class playtest is next week
