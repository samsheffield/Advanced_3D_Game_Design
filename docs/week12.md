# FINAL PROJECT: PRE_PRODUCTION CHECK-IN
Welcome back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Review level planning and greyboxing
- Work, work, work, work, work

## Core Project
A full project description can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tDOYw7MyPxJZYdS6a-K1kuao_4ohD3uiCvcKuJpBMBE/edit?usp=sharing).

### Review level planning and greyboxing
- Have your non-Unity level planning documents and in-engine work ready to share and discuss as a group.

## Work Session: Continue Prototyping
Your focus over the next week is to develop a playable prototype of your game.

## Playable prototypes due next week
This is a functionally complete prototype without finished audiovisual assets. This prototype needs to be playable by others _without your assistance_ and have at least 3 specific questions for your playtesters. 

It's okay for the playable prototype to have bugs (though these should not be undocumented if they are "game breaking").

By the start of class:
- Uploaded Mac, PC, or WebGL builds with included build notes (this includes any necessary info not included in-game and known bugs).
- An online document with at least 3 specific playtesting questions (what do you need player info on?)
- Share links to our class Discord


# Homework

### Continue project development
- Continue developing your game.
- In-class playtesting next week
