# CORE PROJECT: REVIEW LEVEL LAYOUTS & GREYBOXING
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Review level planning and greyboxing
- Work session

## Core Project
A full project description can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tDOYw7MyPxJZYdS6a-K1kuao_4ohD3uiCvcKuJpBMBE/edit?usp=sharing).

### Review level planning and greyboxing
- Upload builds of your greyboxing to your team's Google Drive and share the link on the class Discord.
- Have your non-Unity level planning documents ready to present and discuss.
- __We'll get started with the review at 10:30__

## Work Session: Continue Prototyping
Your focus over the next three weeks is to do level layout work and develop a playable prototype of your game.

## Playable prototypes due next week
This is a functionally complete prototype without finished audiovisual assets. This prototype needs to be playable by others _without your assistance_ and have at least 3 specific questions for your playtesters.   

By the start of class:
- Uploaded Mac & PC builds with included build notes (this includes control mapping, instructions, known bugs, and [if not clear] scope of prototype).
- An online document with your playtesting questions
- Links shared to our class Discord

# Homework

### Continue project development
Complete the playable prototype of your game for class next week.
