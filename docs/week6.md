# CORE PROJECT: BRAINSTORMING & GROUPS
So excited to welcome you all back.Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Take a look at your LUT homework
- Discuss Core Project
- Form groups & brainstorm

## Core Project
This is a small self-directed 3D game developed with Unity on teams. You will be working on this project for the remainder of the semester (though we will sprinkle Unity workshops into the mix from time to time) and expected to meet specific development milestones. _You can make whatever kind of game your team is excited about, just make sure that it involves Unityâ€™s 3D workflow somehow._

A full project description can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tDOYw7MyPxJZYdS6a-K1kuao_4ohD3uiCvcKuJpBMBE/edit?usp=sharing).

### Group Formation
Before you leave:
- You need to be in a group and have a rough idea what roles you will play
- Minimum group size: 2, maximum: 4
- A short description of the game concept your group is most interested in pursuing

## Brainstorming Session
A brainstorming jamboard for us to work with is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g6cBS8CoVhznupujgdbJgbVYsqd4hPklCNn8GxbLU9E/edit?usp=sharing).


# Homework

## Core Project: Begin Pre-Production

### Some notes on pre-production
Here are some notes on this phase of development ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g6cBS8CoVhznupujgdbJgbVYsqd4hPklCNn8GxbLU9E/edit?usp=sharing))

### Produce a planning document
Each team will upload a game design document which includes precedents for mechanics, narrative elements, themes, & art direction.

We'll review these in class next week.


__Deliverable:__
Uploaded document outlining specific plans, goals, precedents, and schedule for the semester. An outline for you to use can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MRfOIbxSUGDb_OteNxvMYAZ8gG4bfAx-dbrSKNwDLXM/edit?usp=sharing)

_Where to upload?_ Make sure I know your team members and I will set up a google Drive folder for you to share.
