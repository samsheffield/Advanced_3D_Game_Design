# Shader Graph Introduction (Part 2)
Some goals for today's class...
- Check out your homework explorations
- Demo: Shader Graph Basics (Vertex Displacement and Noise Shaders)

## Demo: Shader Graph Basics

This is going to be a very hands-on demo. I'll type up notes. _Does anyone need a video?_

### Demo Materials
- [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mDiX60IcdvIKotQlFtz6Pz_pAv4QHVJv/view?usp=sharing) are the Shader Graph examples from class today.

## Open Studio
Please work on your prototype with whatever remaining time we have in class anywhere on the 2nd floor. _Don't leave early without getting permission._

# Homework

## GMD SVA Open Forum This Thursday
Come by the Game Lab this Thursday from 7-8 to discuss GMD/MICA questions or concerns. Bring some snacks. This is your opportunity to provide valuable feedback to our community!

## Prototype 6: Shader Graph Explorations 2
*Turn this in when you finish today.* Here's the project description ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QEMvRF1iXej3sS8FbS-alNmehRa0HYxwYSf1XRpsNNU/edit?usp=sharing))

### What to turn in
I only want *tested* Mac & PC builds uploaded to your Drive folder. _Send me the link_. 

No project files unless there is an issue you want to resolve. WebGL builds are nice, but secondary, concerns in this class. 

#### Mac builds
We have Macs on the floor that you can run [this fix](https://youtu.be/gHZnBzAtBhU) on. **You must run this fix on a Mac if you are building from a PC before sharing the zipped .app file**. Reach out on the MICA Game Lab Discord if you need help testing on a platform you don't develop from.

### Spring Break next week
No homework! Have a great break!
