# CORE PROJECT: REVIEW PLANS & BEGIN PROTOTYPING
So excited to welcome you all back.Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Review research & planning
- Work session

## Core Project

A full project description can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tDOYw7MyPxJZYdS6a-K1kuao_4ohD3uiCvcKuJpBMBE/edit?usp=sharing).

### Present Research
Meet as a large group to discuss research & project ideas. Link to your planning document on the class Discord.

### Work Session: Begin Developing Proof of Concept Prototype(s) 
Your goal this week is to develop at least one prototype which demonstrates how your game works. This is as much about demonstrating _functionality_ as it is about _potential_. Show us _why_ this works, not just _how_ it works!

Also, if you canâ€™t have a basic implementation of core things prototyped by this stage you will be discouraged from adding it later. Figure out what is central to your game.

__Do not design levels or focus on visual assets at this point__. Create _undesigned_ sandbox scene(s) which explore core mechanics (the novel or interesting things a player can do in your game), basic player metrics (scale of player to world and basic movement mechanics), and how your core gameplay works. Keep the assets simple but informative/expressive.

### Working remotely?
If you need to work remotely today, please provide me with documentation via email demonstrating the work you completed today. See homework notes too...

### How are you planning to collaborate?
Now is the time to also make some decisions (if you haven't already) about how you are going to work together and what your process for implementing work and checking-in before class each week will look like.

# Homework

## Core Project: Proof of Concept

### Continue development
Delegate work and make a plan to check-in before leaving today. At this point, it makes sense to have each team member contribute somehow to the development of your proof of concept prototypes.

We'll review these in class next week.

__Deliverable:__
_Where to upload?_ Make sure to upload your proof of concept builds to your shared Drive folder.
