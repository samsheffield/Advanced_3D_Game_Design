# Intro to VR 1
Welcome back from break. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Play & discuss VR games
- Set up Unity toolchain for VR development
- Demo XR Interaction Toolkit

## Justin Sirois class visit tomorrow @ 1pm
Tomorrow! Writer, designer, tabletop game publisher, and MICA alum at Severed Books will be doing an in-person class visit at 1pm to Senior Studio in D200. This is an open visit, so please join us if you're available.

## Graham Wilson online talk tomorrow 11am
Career Development is hosting an online talk by a toy designer and MICA alum that is open to everyone. Check the MGL Discord for the link or 


## Add Android Build Support to your Unity installation
_This will take a good amount of time, so let's get it going in the background while we play some games_

1. Open Unity Hub and select Installs in the sidebat
2. Locate your Unity 2021 installation in the list and click the gear icon next to its name to Add modules
3. Find Android Build Support and in stall both OpenJDK and Android SDK & NDK Tools (warning: this will require several GB of free space)
4. Okay the installation terms

## Optional for Windows users: Install Oculus App
_This is a very big application but will greatly reduce development time in-editor if you want to use it_
1. Install the app from [here](https://www.oculus.com/download_app/?id=1582076955407037)
2. Log in using the gamelab@mica.edu account. _I will give you the password and help with 2FA, if needed_

## Play VR Games
I have a small number of games installed on our Quest 2 headsets for us to play. Find a partner (you'll also need to share headsets in class and for homework). Fingers crossed, we'll be able to all use the sam accout at once!

## Demo: VR Basics
This is going to be a very hands-on demo. [Here's a video](https://youtu.be/VsIxFgpEulk) covering everything we'll do together in class today.

## Open Studio
Please work on your prototype with whatever remaining time we have in class anywhere on the 2nd floor. _Don't leave early without getting permission._

# Homework

## Prototype 7: VR Exploration 1
Here's the project description ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lTNvoSHEMnek0zMlKs9DOi_8KHEQ0q2Fw_HOL35dMfk/edit?usp=sharing)). 

If you're looking for additional functionality/ideas, there are a couple of good Youtube channels I'd recommend. One is [Jason P Barnett](https://www.youtube.com/@JustinPBarnett) and the other is [VR with Andrew](https://www.youtube.com/@VRwithAndrew). We'll cover teleportation next week in-class, but feel free to dip into any techniques or mechanics that you research that seem interesting. Just be prepared to demo and share how they work next week when we meet.

## VR Headsets
You and your partner are responsible for one VR headset that you are allowed to borrow this week. Take good care of it. Do not lose it or leave it unattended anywhere. If this seems like too much responsibility, we can also coordinate with Sammy Weil in the 4F office to make the headset available to check out to you during his weekday office hours. Let me know.

### What to turn in
I only want the *tested* apk file uploaded to your Drive folder. _Send me the link_. 

No project files unless there is an issue you want to resolve. WebGL builds are nice, but secondary, concerns in this class. 

### Prototype show & tell next week
We'll start class next week by having you briefly share your prototypes.
