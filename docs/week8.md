## Core Project

A full project description can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tDOYw7MyPxJZYdS6a-K1kuao_4ohD3uiCvcKuJpBMBE/edit?usp=sharing).

### Present Proof of Concept Prototypes
Meet as a large group to take a look at your proof of concept prototypes.

## Work Session: Begin Level Planning and Prototyping
Your focus over the next three weeks is to do level layout work and develop a playable prototype of your game.

### Level Planning & Blockouts (Due 03/31)

__Level Layout & Planning__

You are responsible for developing parti sketches, bubble diagrams, and marked up floor plans of your levels done outside of Unity. __This is not an optional step__.

[What's all this stuff?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Dg5UPLwQiIX4iHlQaLe4EajpjijYtQQzG-3eqzQKGQ/edit?usp=sharing)

_Deliverable:_

Collect your game's layout planning in a digital document and share in your group's Drive folder. This must include:
- 6 parti thumbnails
- 3 bubble diagrams based on the partis you find most interesting
- Floor plans based on your most promising bubble diagrams and marked up with details on encounters, important things in the scenes, and indication of flow/critical paths

__Greybox/Blockout__

A first pass at blocked out/greyboxed version of your game. Team members working on visual assets for your game can do their work but __no final assets are to be included in this.__ 

[Blockout? Greyboxing?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lrl1fs_mHaHkkeVBSfPLBjaAI7alU8d6-LYwviEZblU/edit?usp=sharing)

_Deliverable:_

Unity project with blocked out scene(s). Player should be able to move around and use basic mechanics in the spaces. Tested Mac & PC builds with included build notes so we can review in class.

### Milestone 1 Prototype (Due 04/05)
A prototype of your game which is playable by others without your assistance which is functionally complete but without finished audiovisual assets. Tested Mac & PC builds with included build notes.

This deadline is just for goal setting. __Don't focus on this now.__

# Homework

## Spring Break
Take a break next week.

### Continue development
Before leaving today, delegate work and make a plan for checking-in after the break. We'll review your group's progress after spring break.
