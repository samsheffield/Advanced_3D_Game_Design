- Any other concerns or questions? (This class, this semester, ...uhh, everything!)

# URP + POST PROCESSING
So excited to welcome you all back. In-person! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Talk about this course, your responsibilities, and what you can expect
- Demo: Universal Render Pipeline and the Post-Processing Stack (Part 1)

## Demo: URP & Post-Processing Stack Intro
- Here are notes for today's class ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UDqfsg5TJKeJyTYImABq_avxl4dfzP7jxke6d8BDPcU/edit?usp=sharing)). 
- Video notes from S22 [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL42xm44H83rK_OUlOTopt_oYKbOKSyKkY). Do we need new ones?

## Open Studio
Please work on your prototype with whatever remaining time we have in class, either in the classroom or in the main lab (sorry, not from home). Let me know if you run into any issues!


# Homework

## Prototype 1: URP/Post-Processing Exploration 
Here's the homework description ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CO2JRE5S-QBC0AHQsttwA9RklMKdsFHKqg8hfofnzek/edit?usp=sharing))

### What to turn in
I only want *tested* Mac & PC builds uploaded to your Drive folder. _Send me the link_. 

No project files unless there is an issue you want to resolve. WebGL builds are nice, but secondary, concerns in this class. 

#### Mac builds
We have Macs on the floor that you can run [this fix](https://youtu.be/gHZnBzAtBhU) on. **You must run this fix on a Mac if you are building from a PC before sharing the zipped .app file**. Reach out on the MICA Game Lab Discord if you need help testing on a platform you don't develop from.

### Prototype show & tell next week
We'll start class next week by having you briefly share your prototypes. This will become pretty routine since we have a wonderfully small-sized class! 

# Coming soon

## Global Game Jam!
Global Game Jam is coming up soon (Feb 3rd-5th). This is a great opportunity to warm up, make another thing to add to your portfolio, work with new people/work with friends/work by yourself, and have fun! Sign up [here](https://globalgamejam.org/2023/jam-sites/mica-game-lab).
