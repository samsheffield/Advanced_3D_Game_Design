# Terrain Tools
Some goals for today's class...
- Check out your homework explorations/GGJ games
- Demo: Unity's Terrain Tools

## Demo: Unity's Terrain Tools
Confusingly, Unity provides two levels of tools to build terrains within the editor. There is a basic Terrain tool, which is already include with Unity (documentation [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Terrain.html)) and the new Terrain Tools package, which significantly extends the toolset.

- Unity's documentation on the Terrain Tools is good. Here's the [link](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.terrain-tools@4.0/manual/index.html)
- We'll add the Terrain Tools pack via the Package Manager.
- We also need the recommended [Terrain Sample Asset Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/terrain-sample-asset-pack-145808) which adds a number of brushes and textures to begin prototyping with. _Note: this package is 1+ GB large._
- We also need some additional [assets for trees and grass](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mz99d_wlutxtcpTGzmQZiIX-qSEXmoBX/view?usp=sharing). Add this unitypackage to your project.



## Open Studio
Please work on your prototype with whatever remaining time we have in class anywhere on the 2nd floor. _Don't leave early without getting permission._

# Homework

## Prototype 3: Terrain Exploration
Here's the project description ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xFTQck1JtbYCNStzUCxtXQ89lIFlkun0JkF5_RhPPsk/edit?usp=sharing))

### What to turn in
I only want *tested* Mac & PC builds uploaded to your Drive folder. _Send me the link_. 

No project files unless there is an issue you want to resolve. WebGL builds are nice, but secondary, concerns in this class. 

#### Mac builds
We have Macs on the floor that you can run [this fix](https://youtu.be/gHZnBzAtBhU) on. **You must run this fix on a Mac if you are building from a PC before sharing the zipped .app file**. Reach out on the MICA Game Lab Discord if you need help testing on a platform you don't develop from.

### Prototype show & tell next week
We'll start class next week by having you briefly share your prototypes.
