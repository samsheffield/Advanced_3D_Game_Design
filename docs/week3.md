Notes for today's class are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R5DflRdQZe2v5qO7dhEFk4HjJNg3frqGc8gpKHADLks/edit?usp=sharing).

## Open Studio
Please work on your prototype with whatever remaining time we have in class anywhere on the 2nd floor. _Don't leave early without getting permission._

# Homework

## Prototype 4: Lighting Exploration
Here's the project description ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zlpgeu4tDyA-DpES-gItBd6pBoByLyfzW10A9e6awHg/edit?usp=sharing))

### What to turn in
I only want *tested* Mac & PC builds uploaded to your Drive folder. _Send me the link_. 

No project files unless there is an issue you want to resolve. WebGL builds are nice, but secondary, concerns in this class. 

#### Mac builds
We have Macs on the floor that you can run [this fix](https://youtu.be/gHZnBzAtBhU) on. **You must run this fix on a Mac if you are building from a PC before sharing the zipped .app file**. Reach out on the MICA Game Lab Discord if you need help testing on a platform you don't develop from.

### Prototype show & tell next week
We'll start class next week by having you briefly share your prototypes.
