# URP + POST PROCESSING
So excited to welcome you all back. In-person! I'm not feeling sick! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Hello!
- Demo: Universal Render Pipeline, Post-Processing

## Demo: URP & Post-Processing Stack Intro
- Here are notes for today's class ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7moRDPjMCfvlIEV5ToE-hh6EnNeInAHKY2EGu2j4xc/edit?usp=sharing)). 
- Videos should be uploaded by Friday morning.

## Open Studio
Please work on your prototype with whatever remaining time we have in class. If you would like to work remotely, please email documentation of what you accomplished (no matter how small!) by the end of the day.


# Homework

## Prototype 1: URP/Post-Processing Exploration 
Here's the project write up ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QIcnZU-erEnhnsBehkEZPyjFc65LXsdQbcaJ0h0D6ac/edit?usp=sharing))

### What to turn in
I only want *tested* Mac & PC builds uploaded to your Drive folder. Reach out to members of the class on Discord if you need help testing on a platform you don't develop from.

### Prototype show & tell next week
We'll start class next week by having you briefly share your prototype. This will become pretty routine since we have a wonderfully sized class!
